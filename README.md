# E-Piano
*use winsound in python to play music like a piano*  
- [x] python3  
* Since the way to make music sounds stranger if note lasts longer,I've slightly changed the time that each kind of note should last.  
* Multithreading is not available,which makes it less like a real piano.  
* More songs can be played if you are familiar with the numbered musical notation and have the time and energy to type.
